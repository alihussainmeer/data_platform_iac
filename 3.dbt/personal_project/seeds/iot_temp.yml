      This seed contains IoT temperature sensor data. Each row represents a temperature reading
      from a device at a specific timestamp. The dataset includes fields such as device identifier,
      timestamp, temperature value, and possibly location or status information.
      It is used for analytics, monitoring, and anomaly detection in IoT environments.
